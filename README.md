REMOTE LAB MONITORING SYSTEM


The idea is to provide a framework for students and instructor. Monitor student's activities during practical time 
is difficult and also teacher has to visit each student's machine to check his practical work. Keeping this in m
ind we are going to implement the framework that "PROVIDES AN INSTRUCTOR-FRIENDLY REMOTE MONITORING OF LAB, EFFECTIVE E
VALUATION, AND GRADING METHODOLOGY". Our goal is to monitor client’s/student’s Activities over a LAN. The aim of this
project is to implement Client Server Protocol Implementation to manage the computer network or a LAN by implementing such 
software to carry out operations which are capable to monitor entire computer lab by sitting on one chair by viewing client’s 
activities, passing messages to client system, file sharing, prevent use of USB Devices and is also able to shut down the 
clients system by performing remote aborting operations. 

Technology to be used:
-->We are going to use the concept of socket programming, Remote commands .Here instructor can perform operations(Restart, stut down,abort) on student's desktop. We will be using django and pycharmfor implementing this project 

The following are The outcomes of this project  :
1.Client/Student login:
--> Whenever user logs-in into the system then his attendance is automatically stored and student
can start working and Student should send his practical work(assignment) to teacher regularly. In case Student gets any 
doubt regarding the assignment he/she can send a help request to the instructor and can chat with instructor.
2.Teacher/Admin login:
--> Whenever new Student is connected to server machine. Teacher can  Maintain Practical attendance record 
and if any student doing other activities then teacher can send warning message to student to stop his activity 
and perform given task. In short teacher Sees icons for all students, Can click on an icon with students and Can 
identify copying codes. An icon blinks if there is a sudden change in picture.
